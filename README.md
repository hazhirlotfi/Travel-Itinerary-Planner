This is my code to plan a trip. You say how much time you have and how many places you want to visit (1-100, keep it reasonable). It uses Floyd-Warshall to get the shortest paths between attractions and a greedy method to pick what fits in your time limit. You can add INF for paths that donâ€™t exist if you want. Prints out the itinerary with visit times and total minutes used.
